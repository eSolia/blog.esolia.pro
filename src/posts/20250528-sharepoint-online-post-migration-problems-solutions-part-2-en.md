In Part 1, we discussed an issue that commonly occurs when migrating to SharePoint Online (SPO): files failing to open when accessed through File Explorer. This problem is often caused by exceeding SPO’s limits on folder depth and file name length. In this article, we’ll focus on how to prevent such issues by using metadata management and adopting more efficient file management practices.

## 1. What is Metadata? 
Metadata means "data about data"—in other words, it’s supplementary information that describes or gives context to other data. 
For example, when you take a photo with your smartphone, the image itself is the data. But the background details, like when and where it was taken, are metadata. 

Typical metadata for photos might include: 
* The date and time the photo was taken 
* Location information (GPS coordinates) 
* The device model (smartphone or camera) 
* Image size and resolution 
* File format (e.g., JPEG, PNG)
  
Here’s an example: 
When you take a photo with your smartphone, metadata such as the date, location, camera specs, and image details are automatically saved with it. 
Hopefully, this gives you a general idea of what metadata is. 
Let’s now take a look at how metadata is used in SharePoint Online.

## 2. What is Metadata in SharePoint Online? 
In SharePoint Online, metadata refers to the "tags" or supplementary information attached to files and list items within sites, libraries, or lists. 

It allows users to easily organize, categorize, and search for content. Key steps include:

* Creating custom columns (e.g., project name, date, category) 
* Setting up views to sort and filter by specific conditions 
* Tagging existing files with metadata to improve searchability

Example: Document Management for Proposals and Contracts 
On a traditional file server, folders are usually organized hierarchically like: 
Year > Department > Project > Contract 
But in SharePoint Online, metadata makes file searching much easier and more dynamic.

**Category**: Labels like "Proposal," "Contract," or "Report" are color-coded and easy to identify. 
**File Name**: Using a naming convention is recommended. 
**Client**: No need for folders—files can be sorted by client using metadata. 
**Owner/Department**: Responsibility is clearly visible based on who owns the document. 
**Contract Status**: You can see progress at a glance via status indicators. 
**Due Date**: Helps clarify timelines and enables filtering by schedule. 

## 3. Why Use Metadata Management? 
Let’s compare traditional folder management with metadata management to better understand the advantages: 
<table class="not-prose w-full text-sm">
  <thead>
    <tr class="bg-blue-100">
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Traditional Folder Management</th>
      <th>Metadata Management</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Searchability</td>
      <td>Manually opening folders to find files</td>
      <td>Instantly find files with keyword search</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Access Control</td>
      <td>Managed by folder permissions</td>
      <td>Flexible control via metadata + permissions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>URL Limitations</td>
      <td>Deep folders lead to long URLs and errors</td>
      <td>Avoid long URLs with flatter structure</td>
    </tr>
　　<tr>
      <td>Sharing & Collaboration</td>
      <td>Permissions must be set per folder</td>
      <td>Views can be customized for each user</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

{{- comp.icon({ name: "arrow-fat-right", size: 4, color: "black" }) -}}**Access Control**: Dividing libraries based on metadata (like departments or confidentiality) helps streamline permissions. 
{{- comp.icon({ name: "arrow-fat-right", size: 4, color: "black" }) -}}**URL Length**: Flat structures prevent long URLs and potential errors. 
{{- comp.icon({ name: "arrow-fat-right", size: 4, color: "black" }) -}}**Collaboration**: Metadata enables cross-functional sharing by classifying content by department, project, or document type. 

While metadata brings major improvements, switching away from traditional folder habits can be challenging. 
To make the most of SharePoint Online, we recommend rethinking your current workflows.

    <tr class="bg-blue-100">
      <th>Traditional Approach</th>
      <th>Recommended in SharePoint Online</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Create foldfers per project</td>
      <td>Use a custum "Project Name" column</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Create folders per year</td>
      <td>Add a "Year" colum and filter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Create folders per pearson</td>
      <td>Add an "Owner" column and manage via views</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## 4. Conclusion 
By adopting metadata management, you can free yourself from rigid folder structures and move toward more flexible, modern file organization. 

With metadata, you can leverage powerful search and customized views, unlocking the full potential of SharePoint Online. 

That said, changing long-standing habits isn't easy. Rather than overhauling everything at once, consider starting small—for example, create a new library for a current project and test out metadata-based management. 

Let’s take the first step together toward a **"new way of file management"** that doesn’t rely on folders!
