"Phishing emails" and "spam emails" — most people have heard these terms from news reports or online articles. 
While many are familiar with the names, more and more sophisticated phishing emails are circulating, and it’s easy to worry about falling for one. 
In this article, we’ll explain how even beginners can recognize phishing emails starting today!

## What is a Phishing Email? 
A phishing email is a type of spam email that aims to deceive recipients for fraudulent purposes. 
The attacker pretends to be a legitimate company or service and sends fake emails in order to steal sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers. 

Since many phishing emails now closely resemble genuine messages, extra caution is necessary. 

## Common Types of Phishing Emails
Here are some typical patterns: 
* Fake delivery notices pretending to be from shipping companies 
* Account suspension or security alerts from banks or credit card companies 
* "Congratulations! You’ve won!" or other unexpected prize notifications

## 5 Key Tips to Spot Phishing Emails 
Here are five practical tips to help you identify phishing emails: 

**1. Check the sender’s email address**
Look at the actual email address, not just the display name. 
For example, an email claiming to be from your bank might come from something like abc123@gmail.com or a random string of meaningless characters. These are red flags.

**2. Watch for awkward or unnatural language** 
Poor grammar or odd phrasing often indicate phishing. 
Example: “Your account will suspended! Immediate response require necessary.”

**3. Inspect the link URLs** 
Hover over any links to verify the actual destination: 
* The URL may start with http instead of secure https 
* The domain name may be slightly altered (e.g., ○○bank.co.jp vs. ○○bank-login.xyz) 
* Company names may be subtly misspelled (e.g., esolia.co.jp vs. ezolia.co.jp)

**4. Beware of urgent or threatening language**
Phishing emails often pressure recipients: 
“Respond within 24 hours,” “Verify your account immediately,” or even threats involving law enforcement or legal action.

**5. Never open suspicious attachments** 
Attachments such as .zip, .exe, or macro-enabled files are especially risky and should not be opened.

## What to Do if You Receive a Suspicious Email 
If possible, delete the email without opening it. 
If you've already opened it: 
* Do not click on any links or open attachments. 
* Contact your IT department immediately. 
* Run a full scan using security software. 

For delivery notifications, instead of clicking links, visit the official website or app directly and check your account for any notices. 

## Summary 
Phishing emails can be highly deceptive, but a bit of caution goes a long way. 
If you ever think, “Is this real…?” — stop, avoid downloading or clicking anything, and consult your IT department or someone you trust.
