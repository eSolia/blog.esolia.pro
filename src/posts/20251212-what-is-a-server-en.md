A Simple Explanation of a Common IT Term 
“Server.” 
You’ve probably heard the word many times, but when someone asks, “Can you explain what it is?” — many people find themselves at a loss for words. 
In this article, we’ll give a gentle and beginner-friendly explanation of the term “server,” which you might know the sound of, but not fully understand.

## Let’s Start with the Basics: What Is a Server? 
A **server** is, in short, **a computer that provides services to other devices.** 
It responds to requests and delivers information or functionality — basically, it plays the role of a “host” that serves others. 
For example: 
* Want to view a webpage? → A server sends that page to your device 
* Want to send an email?  → A server delivers the email to the recipient 
* Want to share a file?　 → A server stores the file and lets others access it
  
In short, everything from browsing websites to sending emails relies on servers working behind the scenes.

## What’s the Difference Between a Server and a Client? 
The word “**client**” often comes up alongside “server.” 
A client is the device that **receives the service**, like your computer or smartphone. 
For example: 
* When you search something on Google from your phone → your device is the client 
* The Google system that returns the search results   → that’s the server 
It’s a “**client makes a request, server responds**” kind of relationship.

## So, Where Are Servers Located? 
You might have never seen one in person, but servers can be found in many places: 
* A company’s office server room 
* Data centers 
* The cloud (e.g., AWS, Microsoft Azure) 
Recently, more companies are moving to **cloud servers**, meaning they don’t need to manage physical machines in-house anymore.

**Examples of Servers You Might Use Without Realizing**

    <tr>
      <td>Viewing a website</td>
      <td>Web server (like Apache or Nginx) </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sending/receiving email</td>
      <td>Mail server (SMTP/IMAP) </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sharing files at work</td>
      <td>File server (e.g., NAS, Windows Server)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

In short: if something is quietly **providing something to others**, it’s probably a server!

## Summary 
A **server** isn’t something overly complicated — it’s just a computer that provides services. 
Even if you weren’t aware of it before, servers are quietly working as the “unsung heroes” behind the internet and our internal systems. 
Doesn’t it feel satisfying to finally understand what you kind of already thought you knew? 
Take this chance to dive a little deeper into familiar IT terms!
