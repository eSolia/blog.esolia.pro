Hidden Water Hazards in the Office
In Japan's climate, the rainy season and typhoon periods bring high humidity and frequent rain—conditions that often lead to unexpected "PC water damage" accidents every year.
Common scenarios include:
“I stepped away from my desk and came back to find mist from a humidifier pouring onto my keyboard…”
“I knocked over my coffee and drenched my laptop.”
“I got caught in a sudden downpour on my way home—my whole bag was soaked.”
These are not rare situations. This article walks you through the proper steps to take when your PC gets wet and highlights the actions you shouldn’t take.

## What to Do Immediately
The first step is to stay calm while taking quick and appropriate action. If your PC gets wet, turn it off immediately. If possible, disconnect the AC adapter and remove the battery. This prevents a short circuit from occurring due to moisture.
Next, gently wipe the surface with a soft cloth or tissue. Avoid using a hairdryer or heat source—let the device air dry in a well-ventilated area.
Do not turn the device upside down or shake it, as this can cause the water to seep deeper into the internal components.
Do not try to disassemble it yourself—this often voids your warranty. And above all, never try to power it back on while it’s still wet. This can cause irreversible damage to the motherboard.

## Be Honest and Quick When Reporting to IT
It’s natural to feel nervous about reporting the incident to your IT department. You might be tempted to say something vague like, “It suddenly stopped working…” while avoiding eye contact.
But IT professionals have seen it all. Their goal isn’t to blame you, but to resolve the issue quickly and minimize downtime.
Be honest and provide as much detail as possible:
* How did it get wet?
* How much water was involved?
* How long has it been since the incident?
Accurate and timely information can significantly affect the recovery outcome. Delays or unclear explanations can lead to bigger problems and extended downtime.

## How IT Admins Handle Water-Damaged PCs
Once notified, your IT admin will begin response procedures. In most companies, service contracts with vendors like Dell or Lenovo include on-site repair support.
Before sending the device for repairs, IT may check whether any data can be recovered, back up important files, or transition your environment to a spare PC.
Even if the incident was caused by user error (e.g., water spills or device drops), many corporate contracts do cover such cases—typically once per year per device.
However, this depends on your company’s specific contract. In cases not covered, you may be facing a costly repair bill ranging from ¥50,000 to ¥100,000 or more.

## What You Can Do to Prevent Future Incidents
Everyone makes mistakes, but you can reduce the risk with a few practical habits:
Use cloud storage (like OneDrive or shared drives) regularly. This ensures your data is safe, even if your device becomes unusable.
Invest in a waterproof laptop sleeve or bag for commuting, especially during rainy seasons.
Avoid placing beverages or humidifiers near your PC. Use cups with lids and keep liquids off your workspace entirely, if possible.
Water damage is more common than you think. It’s not something to be ashamed of or afraid to report. What matters most is how you respond, how honestly you communicate, and how well you prevent it from happening again.
