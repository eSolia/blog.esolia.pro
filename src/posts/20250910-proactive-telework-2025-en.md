In my 2018 blog post[**Telework Offensive,**](https://blog.esolia.pro/en/posts/20180416-telework-offensive_en/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} I shared thoughts on the potential of flexible work styles. At the time, the idea of large-scale telework seemed distant—long before the world was struck by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

## Introduction
Fast forward to 2025. Much has changed. Back then, our company had not yet implemented a telework system, but I personally believed in hybrid work and advocated for it both inside and outside the company. My motivation was simple: I wanted to make better use of my limited time and ease the burden of daily life. 

Then came the pandemic. As the government declared a state of emergency, society quickly pivoted to remote work. Thanks to our early efforts in preparing a remote work environment, we were able to smoothly transition to telework without major disruptions. 

Today, hybrid work—combining remote and in-office days—has become second nature for most of our team. It's safe to say that for many, a work style without telework is no longer imaginable. 

## Current State of Telework
So, what's the current state of Telework in Tokyo? 
The Tokyo Metropolitan Government regularly surveys 10,000 companies within the city to assess the adoption of telework. 

According to the 2024 survey (FY2024) targeting Tokyo-based companies with 30 or more employees, the telework adoption rate was 58.0%. This marks a slight decrease compared to the previous year's 60.1%.

In addition, Tokyo conducts monthly surveys to monitor the telework implementation rate among companies with 30 or more employees. Recent trends show a gradual shift back to office-based work, which appears to be contributing to the slight decline. 

## To "Return to Office" Trend
With the pandemic easing, many companies—including foreign-owned firms—have begun encouraging employees to return to the office. After several years of remote work becoming the norm, the tide now seems to be turning. 

**From a business perspective, the concerns include:**
1. Rebuilding productivity and creativity 
2. Challenges with on-the-job training for younger employees 
3. Difficulties in management and governance (e.g., slacking off, lack of communication) 
4. Weakened company culture and engagement 
5. Pressure to justify investment in office spaces

**From an employee’s perspective, common concerns include:** 
1. Feelings of isolation and reduced communication 
2. Difficulty concentrating due to home environment 
3. Lack of visibility leading to fears of unfair evaluations

So, how should we evolve our working styles from here? 
Reflecting on the thoughts I shared back in 2018, I believe now is the perfect time to revisit what telework truly means.

## Yes, We Still Want to Telework!
Yes—many people still sincerely want to continue working remotely. 
Even with challenges and constraints, telework remains desirable because of the significant benefits it offers: 

1. Saving time and mental energy by eliminating commutes
* Two hours saved each day can be used for self-care or productivity
* Less stress and fatigue can lead to better performance and creativity
2. Greater flexibility in lifestyle
* Easier to balance work with childcare, eldercare, and medical needs
* Helps prevent turnover by supporting employees’ personal lives
3. Inclusivity and diverse work options
* Enables people to build careers without relocating to major cities
* People with disabilities or chronic health issues can work comfortably from home
4. Digital transformation and workflow improvement
* Promotes paperless practices, cloud usage, and process optimization
* Helps visualize who is doing what, reducing individual workload dependencies

## In conclusion
As IT professionals, our role spans a wide range of responsibilities. Through cross-functional communication, we can help solve challenges related to work styles and productivity—one issue at a time. 

If you ever have concerns, ideas, or even vague hopes like “Wouldn’t it be nice if…,” don’t hesitate to reach out to your IT team. We’re here not just to fix problems, but to help shape better ways of working—for everyone.
