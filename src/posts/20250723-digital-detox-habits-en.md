Have You Ever Felt Drained Surrounded by Digital Devices? 
I work as an IT support specialist in a corporate environment, so I’m usually very close to digital devices in my daily life. In this article, I’d like to share a few simple digital detox habits that I personally practice. They may be small things, but I hope they’ll be helpful for anyone who has felt the same kind of fatigue.

## What Is Digital Detox? 
According to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries, a digital detox is: 
*a period of time when a person does not use digital devices such as smartphones or computers, especially in order to reduce stress and relax. *
This term was added to the online version of the Oxford Dictionary in 2013 and has gradually become more widely recognized. 

## What Made Me More Aware of It
iPhones were already widely used when I was a student, but the apps back then weren’t as addictive as they are now. At most, checking Twitter or Instagram for friends’ updates was a small daily pleasure. 
It’s only in the past five years or so that I began to really relate to the idea of a digital detox. 

Despite working with digital devices all day, I found myself staying up late watching videos, or endlessly checking social media without any real purpose. 
These small habits added up over time, and I started feeling a vague sense of fatigue from the sheer amount of information. Eventually, it became a more noticeable discomfort. 

While I’m truly grateful for the convenience and possibilities digital technology brings, I can no longer ignore the fatigue and stress that can come with it. 
I imagine I’m not the only one who feels this way. 

## How I Try to Maintain a Healthy Distance
It’s not easy to completely cut off from digital life these days, but I believe the key is finding a balance that doesn’t feel forced. 
When we hear the word “detox,” we might feel pressured to quit all digital devices at once—but that in itself can become stressful. 
Personally, I think having a relaxed mindset like “let’s just cut back a little” is perfectly fine. 

Here are some small things I do to avoid becoming overwhelmed by information: 

### At Work

Instead of using a smartphone app, I write down quick notes with pen and paper. Especially when I feel stuck, writing things out on a blank sheet helps organize my thoughts. 
It also gives a good impression to others—like I’m focused and taking things seriously. 

{{- comp.icon({ name: "check-fat", size: 4, color: "sky" }) -}}**Keep my desktop clean** 
Has your desktop ever gotten cluttered without you realizing it? 
I make it a habit to tidy up from time to time, removing unnecessary files, shortcuts, and apps. 
A clean desktop reduces visual noise and encourages better file management. It also helps improve work efficiency. 

{{- comp.icon({ name: "check-fat", size: 4, color: "sky" }) -}}**Use noise-canceling earphones as earplugs on the commute** 
Commuter trains can be overloaded with information—noise, crowds, and advertisements. 
I intentionally don’t play music or podcasts, and just use the noise-canceling function. Surprisingly, that alone helps me feel calm. Regular earplugs work well too.

### On Days Off and During Daily Life
{{- comp.icon({ name: "check-fat", size: 4, color: "sky" }) -}}**Use iPhone’s Screen Time feature** 
The Screen Time feature on the iPhone lets you set daily time limits for specific apps. 
When you hit the limit, a prompt appears with options like “Close now,” “One more minute,” “Remind me in 15 minutes,” or “Ignore for today.” 
It’s easy to feel like you haven’t spent much time on your phone, but Screen Time makes you aware of just how much time you’re actually using. 

> [!NOTE]
> How to set it up: 
1. Open “Settings” → “Screen Time” 
2. Tap “App Limits” → “Add Limit” 
3. Select the apps you want to limit 
4. Set your preferred time

{{- comp.icon({ name: "check-fat", size: 4, color: "sky" }) -}}**Carry a book with you**
Having a book on hand helps prevent me from reaching for my phone out of boredom. 
I choose something with a bit of weight, like a paperback, so I feel more motivated to read it—after all, I brought it with me. 

{{- comp.icon({ name: "check-fat", size: 4, color: "sky" }) -}}**Don’t charge devices by the bed** 
When I charge my smartphone or smartwatch by my bed, I notice a big difference in how refreshed I feel in the morning compared to when I keep them away. 
I can’t explain it scientifically, but I’ve found I feel less sleepy and foggy during the day. 
Try it—it might work for you too. 

{{- comp.icon({ name: "check-fat", size: 4, color: "sky" }) -}}**Plan offline time without your phone or PC**
On weekends, I plan activities that don’t require digital devices. 
Walking or jogging is a great option—it’s free, refreshing, and helps you reset. 

One of my favorite hobbies is hiking. When I’m surrounded by nature, I notice things I normally wouldn’t: the sound of the wind, birds chirping, the scent of trees… 
It feels like my senses get a reset, and I can recharge deeply. 
Spending time in nature is one of the best ways to step away from digital life. And best of all—it’s something I can continue doing easily and consistently. 

## In Closing
If you ever feel exhausted from too much information, it might be your mind and body telling you it’s time to take a step back. 
Start small—like setting Screen Time limits or planning offline activities for the weekend. 
May your days gain a little more breathing room and peace. I'm quietly cheering you on.
