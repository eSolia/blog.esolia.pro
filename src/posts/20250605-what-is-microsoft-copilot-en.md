In recent years, various types of generative AI have evolved and are attracting attention from the public. This time, we will introduce basic information about **Microsoft Copilot**, a generative AI tool developed by Microsoft, its fee structure, how to use the free version, and examples of how to use it.

## Basic introduction to Microsoft Copilot 
Microsoft Copilot can search for information and generate documents and images using AI, and the paid version can create emails and Word documents, reducing the workload. 

* Real-time information search and document generation: It can also handle ambiguous questions, generate answers based on search results from Microsoft's search engine "Bing," and create documents such as emails and letters. 
* Image generation: It is possible to generate images from text, check the contents of images, and provide information. 
* Q&A through voice conversation: It is possible to input voice, generate answers by voice, and transcribe and translate audio files. 
* (Paid version) Integration with Microsoft 365: It can be integrated with Microsoft 365 apps such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook to make work more efficient.

## Pricing system 
The differences between the free and paid versions are summarized below. The free version is suitable for use as an AI assistant that you can try out casually, while the paid version is suitable for those who want to integrate with Microsoft 365 and use advanced functions. We recommend that you choose the version that best suits your purpose and the functions you need.

## Examples of how to use Copilot 
### 1.Details of Copilot Prompts
**Basics of prompts:** A prompt is a question to the generation AI. According to the Microsoft official website (details of Copilot prompts<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/ja-jp/topic/copilot-%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%83%B3%E3%83%97%E3%83%88%E3%81%AE%E8%A9%B3%E7%B4%B0-f6c3b467-f07c-4db1-ae54-ffac96184dd5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">details of Copilot prompts</a>), you should create a question that combines the four elements of "goal + context + expectation + source." 

**Goal**: What a user wants Copilot to do. Setting a specific goal will allow Copilot to tackle the task without hesitation. 
Example: A question like "Please conduct market research on XX and perform a comparative analysis with competitors A, B, and C" is more specific than a question like "Please conduct market research on XX." 

**Context:** Prerequisite information (such as the reason for the need). The user provides the background information Copilot needs to carry out the task.
Example: "Make a trip plan" is unlikely to give the users the answer they are looking for. If a question is asked like "When, who, where, budget XX yen, XX days, XX nights, staying at XX hotel," Copilot will be able to grasp more accurate information and provide an answer based on the information the user is looking for.

**Expectation**: The form of the desired output. By telling Copilot “In what format you want the answer to be," you can use the information more efficiently. 
Example: "Please narrow down the report to three main points in bullet points." 
Example: "Please create this travel plan for children." 

**Source**: What information will be used in Copilot. By specifying the information to be referenced by Copilot, you can increase the reliability of the information and eliminate unintended information. 
Example: "Please explain about XX based on the information published in (website URL)." 
Example: "Please summarize XX based on the contents of this [file name]." 

It is not necessarily necessary to enter all four elements, but you will get a clearer answer if you include one of them. In addition, if you are not satisfied with the first answer and modify the prompt while interacting with Copilot, you can obtain a more accurate output. 

For example, in our blog post ["UTP cable? Cat cable? RJ45 connector? Admin staff asked AI about IT terms they were curious about,"](https://blog.esolia.pro/en/posts/20250410-admin-asked-ai-about-the-it-terminology-en/){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} the first prompt was "What is a UTP cable?", and the next prompt was "What are UTP cable, Cat cable, and RJ45 connector? Please explain it in an easy-to-understand way for people without IT knowledge."  
In this way, by clarifying ambiguous parts and changing your perspective, you can convey your request to Copilot multiple times and arrive at the answer your users are looking for. 

In addition, to avoid the risk of information leakage, please be careful not to include important information such as highly confidential information or personal information in the prompts of generation AI including Copilot.

> [!CAUTION]
> Points to note: 
> ・Limit on the amount of information: Copilot has a limit on the amount of information it can process at one time, so avoid directly inputting long prompts or large files.
> ・Total number of chats per day: Up to 300 times/day (unlimited with paid version)
> ・Number of chats per session: Up to 30 turns
> ・Maximum size of reference files: 10MB with Microsoft 365 license, up to 2GB/day of total uploads.
