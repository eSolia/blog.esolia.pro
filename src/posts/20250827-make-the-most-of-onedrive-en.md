Just started using Microsoft 365 and wondering, “What’s the difference between OneDrive and SharePoint?”
In this article, we’ll explain the basics of OneDrive and SharePoint, how to use them effectively, and how to distinguish between the two—clearly and simply for beginners.

## First, a Quick Review: What is Cloud Storage?
OneDrive and SharePoint are types of cloud storage services—online tools that allow you to save and manage files over the internet.

**Key features of cloud storage:**
**Online access**: You can access your files from anywhere with an internet connection.
**Backup support**: Your data is easier to recover in case of disasters or device failures.
**Easy file sharing**: Share files simply by sending a link.

## What is OneDrive?
OneDrive is primarily a **personal cloud storage** service. It’s designed for individual users to store and sync files across multiple devices.

**Main features of OneDrive:**
1. **Personal storage**: Each user gets their own storage space.
In the case of OneDrive for Business (a paid enterprise service), around 1 TB is available by default.
2. **Easy file sharing**: Share specific files or folders by sending a link.
3. **Device sync**: Seamless syncing across Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and more.
4. **Private data management**: OneDrive for Business allows employees to safely store and share their work-related files.

## 3 Handy OneDrive Features for Everyday Work
Now that you know the basics, here are three easy-to-use features that can make OneDrive even more helpful in your day-to-day tasks.

### 1. Version History
If you accidentally edit a file or need to undo changes made during collaboration, OneDrive’s version history lets you restore previous versions. It supports various file types including Microsoft 365 documents, PDFs, images, and videos.

> [!NOTE]
> Procedure:
1. Right-click the target file on OneDrive.
2. Select “Version history” to display previous versions of the file.
3. Choose “Restore” or “Open” to review or revert to an earlier version.

### 2. Save Disk Space
With the Files On-Demand feature, you can save disk space by downloading only the files you need. The rest remain in the cloud. This is ideal for PCs with limited storage.

> [!NOTE]
> Procedure:
1. Open OneDrive settings
Right-click the cloud icon (OneDrive) in the notification area on the bottom right of the taskbar.
2. Go to the “Sync and Backup” or “Settings” tab and look for the option called “Files On-Demand”.
3. Click “Free up space” to proceed.
This will automatically remove files that haven’t been used for a long time from the local storage and keep them in the cloud only.

### 3. Offline Access
Set certain files or folders to "Always keep on this device", and they’ll be downloaded ahead of time. This allows you to view and edit them even without an internet connection—perfect for travel or fieldwork.

> [!NOTE]
> Procedure:
1. Open the OneDrive folder in File Explorer, then right-click the file or folder you need.
Files with a cloud icon are in online-only status.
2. Click “Always keep on this device” to download the file locally.

## Understanding the Difference: OneDrive vs. SharePoint
So, what exactly makes SharePoint different from OneDrive?

## What is SharePoint?
SharePoint is a platform designed for team and organization-wide collaboration. It’s more than just storage—it’s also a document management and workflow automation tool that supports building team sites and more.

**Main features of SharePoint:**
1. **Team-based storage**: Optimized for file sharing and management across teams and organizations.
2. **Advanced access control**: Grant different access levels to different users.
For example, payroll documents for the finance team can be restricted from general employees.
3. **Content management**: Rich features like version control, metadata tagging, and search make it easy to organize large volumes of documents.
4. **Integrated workflows**: Connect with tools like Power Automate to streamline business processes.

“Where are my Teams files saved—OneDrive or SharePoint?”
It depends on how you're sharing:
<table class="not-prose w-full text-sm">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Sharing Method</th>
      <th>Storage Location</th>
      <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Team (channel posts)</td>
      <td>SharePoint</td>
      <td>Saved automatically in the team’s document library</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Chat (1:1 or group)</td>
      <td>OneDrive</td>
      <td>Stored in the sender’s OneDrive with shared access</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

In other words, the storage location changes based on the sharing method. OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams work together—understanding how they’re connected helps avoid confusion.

## In Summary
* Use OneDrive for files you manage individually.
* Use SharePoint for files shared and organized across a team.
  
Though they may seem similar, understanding their roles helps prevent lost files and sharing mistakes—leading to smoother, more efficient work.
We hope the OneDrive tips shared here come in handy in your daily tasks!
