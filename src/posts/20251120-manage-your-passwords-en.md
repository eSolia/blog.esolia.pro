A Beginner-Friendly Guide to Password Management 
Do you reuse the same password for multiple accounts? 
Or do you tend to choose something easy to remember? 
Passwords are essential keys that protect our personal and professional information. 
But if they’re easy for you to remember, they might also be easy for others to guess. 
In this article, we’ll look at how to manage passwords safely, and how to create stronger, harder-to-guess passwords — even for beginners.

## Passwords That Are Easy to Guess 
Here are some common cases where passwords are at risk: 
* Using the same password across multiple services 
* Using simple and predictable passwords like 123456 or password123 
* Using personal information like your birthday or pet’s name
  
In recent years, **credential stuffing attacks** (where attackers use leaked IDs and passwords from other services) have become more common — so it’s more important than ever to strengthen your password habits.

## How to Create Strong but Memorable Passwords 
Random strings are strong — but hard to remember. 
Luckily, with a few simple rules, you can create passwords that are both secure and memorable. 

Example: Base word is “esolia”
<table class="not-prose w-full text-sm">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Weak Password</th>
      <th>Strengthened Version</th>
      <th>Points</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>esolia</td>
      <td>es0li@/ esoL1a</td>
      <td>replace letters with similar symbols or numbers</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>esolia123</td>
      <td>esoLiA!123</td>
      <td>add uppercase, symbols, and numbers</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>esolia2024</td>
      <td>esolia-OSUSHI-77-!</td>
      <td>combine with unrelated words and numbers</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> [!TIP]
> Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
> Add random or unrelated words
> Slightly modify a familiar word using a personal rule

## Where Should You Store Your Passwords? 
The stronger your passwords are, the harder they are to remember — that’s where password managers come in. 

At Esolia, we use… 
Our company uses a password management tool called **Codebook**, which helps store and manage passwords securely. 
* Passwords are encrypted and stored safely 
* You can sync data across your PC and mobile devices 
* Includes a password generator 
* Supports two-factor authentication (2FA) settings

Other password managers include **Keeper**, **Bitwarden**, and **LastPass** — but please follow company guidelines when choosing tools. 

## 3 Basic Rules for Password Management 

1. **Don’t reuse passwords**
 → Use different passwords for different services 
2. **Change passwords regularly** 
 → Especially for important accounts, every 3–6 months is recommended 
3. **Use two-factor authentication (2FA) or MFA** 
 → Adds an extra layer of protection, even if your password is compromised

## Summary 
Passwords are like keys — and you wouldn’t want a door that opens with a coin. 
Creating strong and secure passwords is the first step in protecting your data. 
Make use of tools like Codebook to manage passwords safely, without relying on memory alone!
