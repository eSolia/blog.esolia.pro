Notifications that suddenly pop up from the edge of the screen while you’re working on your PC.
Email alerts, Teams messages, Windows Update notices—while convenient, they can also break your concentration.
However, turning off notifications indiscriminately comes with the risk of missing important alerts or business communications.
In this article, we’ll show you how to effectively control notification settings in Windows 11, along with some common pitfalls to watch out for.

## Notification Basics
In Windows 11, notifications mainly fall into two types:

**Banner notifications**
Pop-up messages that appear in the lower-right corner for a few seconds. Clicking them opens the app or message.

**Notification Center**
A history of notifications that you can open by pressing <kbd>Win</kbd>+ <kbd>N</kbd> or clicking the clock area on the far right of the taskbar.

## How to Turn Off Notifications
#### Turn off notifications for all apps
1. Go to Settings → System → **Notifications**
2. Turn off the Notifications switch
→ Notifications from all apps will no longer be shown.

#### Turn off notifications for specific apps
On the same screen, select unnecessary apps under **Notifications from apps and other senders**, and turn off their notification switches.

#### Hide Notifications on the Lock Screen
1. Go to Settings → System → Notifications
2. Turn off Show notifications on the lock screen
→ Useful for preventing shoulder surfing when you’re out or using a shared PC.

## Manage Notifications While Staying Focused with “Focus”
In Windows 11, **Focus** replaces the old “Focus Assist.”
Focus suppresses notifications and badge alerts for a specified period, helping you concentrate on your work.

#### How to Use Focus
1. Go to Settings → System → Focus
2. Set a duration using the Focus timer (e.g., 30 minutes)

While Focus is active, the following are automatically enabled:
* Notification suppression (only priority notifications are allowed)
* Taskbar icon badges are hidden
* Teams and Outlook notifications are temporarily paused

You can also access Focus quickly:
Start Focus directly from the **Clock widget** (bottom-right of the taskbar)

## Important Pitfalls You Should Know

**Important notifications may also be suppressed**
→ Add apps you still want to receive notifications from to the Priority notifications list
(Settings → System → Notifications)
**You might miss Windows Update restart warnings**
→ If you use Focus for long periods, check for updates in advance
**App-level notification settings are not synced**
→ If notifications are disabled within an app itself, they won’t appear even if Windows notifications are turned on
**Notifications may arrive all at once after Focus ends**
→ You may overlook them, so be sure to check the Notification Center afterward

## Recommended Settings for Business Use

■**During work hours (e.g., 9:00–17:00)**
* Notifications ON (allow only Teams, Outlook, and security alerts)
* Turn off SNS and news apps

■**During deep-focus work**
* Focus for 30–60 minutes + register important apps in the Priority list

■**During meetings**
* Allow only Teams notifications
* Block everything else with Focus

## Summary
By using Focus in Windows 11, you can strike a balance between maintaining concentration and staying informed, without completely disabling notifications.

> [!TIP]
> Use notification settings and Focus appropriately
> Receive only essential information via the Priority notifications list
> Always check the Notification Center after Focus ends

Set things up correctly and maximize your work efficiency.
